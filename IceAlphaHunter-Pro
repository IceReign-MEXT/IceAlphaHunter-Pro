## 📈 What You Need To Build Next (The Secret Sauce)

The code is live. To make it unstoppable, your next step is to build the actual **data generation and filtering logic** that feeds into the `send_alert` function.

**Build:** The hidden logic that decides *when* a signal is truly VIP-worthy and sends it through the `send_alert(is_vip=True, ...)` path.

**Once you push this new README, your GitHub house becomes a professional storefront.**
